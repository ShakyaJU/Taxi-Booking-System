<h1 align="center">Taxi Booking System</h1>

<h3 style="text-align: justify;">This Python project demonstrates key principles of N-tier architecture, featuring a structured and user-friendly taxi booking and management system. The application starts with a Login and Registration Page, where customers, drivers, and admins can access their respective interfaces. Customers can book, update, and cancel trips, drivers can view assigned bookings, and admins manage the overall system, assigning drivers and monitoring records.

Developed in PyCharm IDE, the GUI was designed using Tkinter, following a prototype created in Balsamiq Wireframes. External libraries such as mysql-connector-python (for database connection), Pillow (for image handling), and tkcalendar (for date entry) were integrated to enhance functionality. The database was managed using phpMyAdmin (MySQL), with XAMPP used as the local server.
<pre>
The system follows a four-layer architecture:

Frontend Layer â€“ Manages the GUI using Tkinter.
Business Layer â€“ Handles core logic and validation.
Database Layer â€“ Uses MySQL queries for data retrieval.
Models Layer â€“ Defines getter and setter properties for system entities.
